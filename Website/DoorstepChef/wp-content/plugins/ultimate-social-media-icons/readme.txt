== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Please also check the more comprehensive FAQ on http://ultimatelysocial.com/faq =


= I face fundamental issues (the plugin doesn't load etc.) =

Please ensure that: 

- You're using the latest version of the plugin(s)
- Your site is running on PHP 5.4 or above 
- You have CURL activated (should be activated by default)

If you're not familiar with those please contact your hosting company or server admin.

Please check if you have browser extensions activated which may conflict with the plugin. Known culprits include:

- Open SEO Stats (Formerly: PageRank Status) in Chrome
- Adblock Plus in Chrome
- Vine in Chrome

Either de-activate those extensions or try it in a different browser.

If the plugin setting's area looks 'funny' after an upgrade then please clear your cache with String+F5 (PC) or Command+R (Mac).

Please also try if the other plugin works: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/

= I get error messages 'Error : 7', 'Error : 56', 'Error : 6' etc. =

Those point to a CURL-issue on your site. Please contact your server admin or your hosting company to resolve it.

= Icons don't show = 

Please ensure you actually placed them. The USM+ plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/) makes placing icons especially easy (separate question 3).

If only some icons show, but not all, then please clear your cache, and check if you may have conflicting browser extensions (e.g. 'Disconnect'-app in Chrome). Also Ad-Blockers are known culprits, please switch them off temporarily to see if that is the reason.

If the icons still don't show then there's an issue with your template. Please contact the creator of your template for that. 

= Twitter share-counts are not displaying (anymore) =

Unfortunately, Twitter stopped providing that information.

= Changes don't get saved / Deleted plugin but icons still show = 

Most likely you have the WP Cache plugin installed. Please de-activate and then re-activate it.

= Links don't work = 

Please ensure you've entered the ´http://ª at the beginning of the url. If the icons are not clickable at all there is most likely an issue with your template. 

= I cannot upload custom icons = 

Most likely that's because you've set 'allow_url_fopen' to 'off'. Please turn it to 'on' (or ask your server admin to do so ñ he'll know what to do).

= My Youtube icon (direct follow) doesn't work = 

Please ensure that you've selected the radio button 'Username' when you enter a youtube username, or 'Channel ID' when you entered a channel ID.

= Aligning the icons (centered, left- or right-aligned) doesn't work = 

The alignment options under question 5 align the icons with respect to each other, not where they appear on the page. Everything else is template work. 

= Clicking on the RSS icon returns funny codes = 

That's normal ñ RSS users will know what to do with it (i.e. copy & paste the url into their RSS readers).

= Facebook 'like'-count isn't correct = 

When you 'like'ù something on your blog via facebook it likes the site you're currently on (e.g. your blog) and not your Facebook page.

Therefore it also doesn't show the number of your facebook followers however that's something we're thinking about offering as well.

= Sharing doesn't take the right text or picture = 

We use the codes from Facebook, Google+ etc. and therefore don't have any influence over which text & pic gets shared.

Note that you can define an image as 'Featured Image' which tells Facebook / Google etc. to take that one. You'll find this 'Featured Image' section in your blog's admin area where you can edit your blog post.

You can crosscheck which image Facebook will take by entering your url on https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/.

= The pop-up shows although I only gave my icon one function = 

The pop-up only disappears if you've given your icons only a 'visit us'-function, otherwise (e.g. if you gave it 'Like'ù (on facebook) or 'Tweet'ù-functions) a pop-up is still needed because the buttons for those are coming directly from the social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and we don't have any influence over their design.

= I selected to display icons after every post but they don't show = 

They usually do show, however not on your blog page, but on your single posts pages. The USM+ plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/) also allows to display the icons on your homepage.

= Plugin decreases my site's loading speed = 

The USM and USM+ plugins are one of the most optimized social media plugins in terms of impact on a site's loading speed (optimized code, compressed pictures etc.).

If you still experience loading speed issues, please note that:

- The more sharing- and invite- features you place on your site, the more external codes you load (i.e. from the social media sites ñ we just use their code), therefore impacting loading speed. So to prevent this, give your icons only 'Visit us'-functionality rather than sharing-functionalities.

- We've programmed it so that the code for the social media icons is the one which loads lasts on your site, i.e. after all the other content has already been loaded. This means: even if there is a decrease in loading speed, it does not impact a user's experience because he sees your site as quickly as before, only the social media icons take a bit longer to load.

There might be also other issues on your site which cause a high loading speed (e.g. conflicts with our plugins or template issues). Please ask your template creator about that.

= After moving from demo-server to live-server the follow/subscribe-link doesn't work anymore = 

Please delete and install the plugin again.

If you already placed the code for a subscription form on your site, remove it again and take the new one from the new plugin installation.

= When I try to like/share via Facebook, I get error message ''App Not Setup: This app is stillÖ' = 

If you get the error messageÖ

'App Not Setup: This app is still in development mode, and you don't have access to it. Switch to a registered test user or ask an app admin for permissions.'

Öthen most likely you're currently logged in with a business account on Facebook. Please logout, or switch to your personal account.

= There are other issues when I activate the plugin or place the icons = 

Please check the following:

Please try the other plugin, i.e. if you use our USM plugin, please also try it with the USM+ plugin and vice versa.

The plugins require that CURL is installed & activated on your server (which should be the standard case). If you don't have it, please contact your hosting provider.

Please ensure that you don't have any browser extension activated which may conflict with the plugin, esp. those which block certain content. Known culprits include the 'Disconnect'ù-extension in Chrome or the 'Privacy Badger'ù-extension in Firefox.

If issues persist most likely your theme has issues which makes it incompatible with our plugin. Please contact your template creator for that. 

= How can I see how many people shared or liked my post? = 

You can see this by activating the 'counts' on the front end (under question 4 in the USM plugin, question 5 in the USM+ plugin).

We cannot provide you this data in other ways as it's coming directly from the social media sites. One exception: if you like to know when people start to follow you by email, then you can get email alerts. For that, please claim your feed (see question above).

= How can I change the 'Please follow & like us :)'? = 

You can change it in the Widget-area where you dropped the widget on the sidebar. Please click on it (on the sidebar), it will open the menu where you can change the text.

If you don't want to show any text, just enter a space (' ').

= How can I remove the credit-link ('Powered by Ultimatelysocial')? = 

Please note that we didn't place the credit link without your consent (you agreed to it when de-selecting the email-icon).

Open the first question in the plugin ('1. Which icons do you want to show on your site?'), on the level of the email-icon you see a link on the right hand side. Please click it to remove the credit link.

= Can I use a shortcode to place the icons? = 

Yes, it's [DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_SOCIAL_ICONS]. You can place it into any editor.

Alternatively, you can place the following into your codes: <?php echo do_shortcode('[DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_SOCIAL_ICONS]'); ?> 

= Can I get more options for the icons next to posts? = 

Please use this plugin for that: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/

= Can I also give the email-icon a ëmailto:' functionality? = 

Yes, you can! For that please upload an email icon as custom icon, and then enter the mailto:-link (and email) under question 2.

To get the email-icon in the same design style you picked, activate it, then on the front-end, rightclick on the icon, and save it as picture. Upload that picture as custom icon.

= Can I also display the icons vertically? = 

Yes. For that please go to question 5 and select to display only 1 icon per row.

= How can I change the text on the 'visit us'-buttons? = 

Use this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/

= Can I deactivate the icons on mobile? = 

Yes, there's an option for that under question 5.

= How can I use two instances of the plugin on my site? = 

You cannot use the same plugin twice, however you can install both the USM as well as the USM+ plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/). We've developed the code so that there are no conflicts and they can be used in parallel.
